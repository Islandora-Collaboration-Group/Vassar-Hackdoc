### How to Use the ICG Webform - For End Users

## Submitting an Islandora Webform

* An authenticated user will see in a link that will launch a webform, when s/he is in an Islandora collection for which an IW webform has been enabled and is viewing an object of the type for which a webform has been designed.

* To submit a new webform:
  * Click on the link to submit a caption. A form box will open.

*  
  * Fill in the fields with your submission text.
  * When finished, click "Submit". You can then “View”, “Edit” or “Delete” you submission on the “Submissions” page.        
* To edit a previously submitted caption:
  * Go to the object you submitted a caption on.
  * Click the "Submissions" link.

* You cannot edit a previously submitted caption if you see the link “Re-ingest’ (in red font) because that means it has already been approved and ingested into Islandora. Ingested ones cannot be changed. If you decide to edit it anyway, a new Islandora submission object will be created and the original one will remain as well; there is no way you can delete it.
  * Find your submission, which is probably the last one added to the list. If it has not yet been ingested, you can safely edit it.
  * Click "Edit".
    * Make your changes.
  * Click “Save”.
