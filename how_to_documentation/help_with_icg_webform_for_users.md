* 1. How to submit an Islandora Webform

* An authenticated user will see in a link that will launch a webform, when s/he is in an Islandora collection for which an IW webform has been enabled and is viewing an object of the type for which a webform has been designed.

* To submit a new webform:
  * Click on the link to submit a caption. A form box will open.

*  
  * Fill in the fields with your submission text.
  * When finished, click "Submit". You can then “View”, “Edit” or “Delete” you submission on the “Submissions” page.
* To edit a previously submitted caption:
  * Go to the object you submitted a caption on.
  * Click the "Submissions" link.

* You cannot edit a previously submitted caption if you see the link “Re-ingest’ (in red font) because that means it has already been approved and ingested into Islandora. Ingested ones cannot be changed. If you decide to edit it anyway, a new Islandora submission object will be created and the original one will remain as well; there is no way you can delete it.
  * Find your submission, which is probably the last one added to the list. If it has not yet been ingested, you can safely edit it.
  * Click "Edit".
    * Make your changes.
  * Click “Save”.

**2. How to upload a file**

* [THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENT OR VERIFIED YET.]

* Be sure you are in the collection to which you want to submit your upload.
* If you are authorized to upload an object to this collection, you will see a block in the left sidebar labeled "Submitter Options" and in it a link labeled "Upload a file".
* The purpose of this is to make it possible for an authenticated user to upload objects that are ingested as related to the object being viewed.

* Click the “Upload a file” link.
* Select the content type of the object you will be uploading (PDF, basic image, etc.)
* Enter some metadata (only a "Title" is actually required).' Click "Next".
* Click "Browse".
  * Select the file on your computer.
  * Click "Upload".
* Click "Ingest".

* Then if you want to add a caption to it, click the link under the object "Submit a caption or transcription."
* These uploads will be ingested into Fedora, but they will not be visible to anonymous users until they are approved.
* [dev comment: We still have to look into the details of permissions to be sure these users can't mess with with objects other than their own. I'm not sure that is possible.
