Best Practice: 

	- Use a 720p USB video, instead of the default laptop video

	- Use a tripod for video camera to get better angle instead of looking up their nose (ie laptop camera)

	- hardwire the laptop to network to ensure best Internet connection

	- For capturing a presentation, consider best to do the recording directly from the presenter's laptop so they may easily control screenshares
