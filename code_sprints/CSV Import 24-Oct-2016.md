Our first ICG CSV Import code sprint was conducted via Go-to-Meeting at 9:00 AM Eastern on 24-Oct-2016.  On the call were Mark McFate (organizer), Peter MacDonald, and Ben Rosner.  The agenda was intended to include:

Sprint Call Structure (2 hour call)
~30 minutes for each of the following topics:
- Briefly discuss the state of the project and identify remaining tasks, and 
- Assign tasks/roles to willing individuals.
- Assist all participants to establish a workflow and environment to build in.
- Q&A, followed by start of collaboration!

Ben had to depart after about 30 minutes so we dedicated significant time to the first topic leaving Mark and Peter to engage in the remaining agenda topics.  Meeting was adjourned at 10:15 AM.
