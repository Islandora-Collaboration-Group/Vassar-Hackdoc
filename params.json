Additionally, ICG has working groups which meet via hangouts/skype and also conducts code sprints to continue projects from hack/doc events.\r\nGeneral communication and meeting announcements happen via the islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com mailing list. Working groups or project teams may have mailing lists for discussions specific to that team or project.\r\n\r\n## Members\r\n\r\n* 3CDL (Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke, Smith College)\r\n* [Barnard College](http://digitalcollections.barnard.edu)\r\n* [Grinnell College](https://digital.grinnell.edu/)\r\n* [Hamilton College](http://dhinitiative.org)\r\n* [Vassar College](https://digitallibrary.vassar.edu)\r\n* Wesleyan University\r\n* [Williams College](http://unbound.williams.edu)\r\n\r\n## How to participate\r\n\r\n* Send a request to the ICG (islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com)\r\n\r\n## Membership\r\n\r\n* Barnard College\r\n  * [Benjamin Rosner](https://github.com/br2490) (Application Developer)\r\n  * [Martha Tenney](https://github.com/MarthaTenney) (Digital Archivist)\r\n* Grinnell College\r\n  * Rebecca Ciota (Discovery and Systems Librarian)\r\n  * [Mark McFate](https://github.com/McFateM) (Digital Library Applications Developer)\r\n* Hamilton College\r\n  * Shay Foley (Director, Metadata and Digital Strategies)\r\n  * [Greg Lord](https://github.com/gplord) (DHI Lead Designer and Software Engineer)\r\n  * [Peter MacDonald](https://github.com/dhinitiative) (Library Information Systems Specialist)\r\n  * Lisa McFall (Metadata and Catalog Librarian)\r\n  * [Aaron Neslin](https://github.com/aneslin) (Discovery and Delivery Systems Analyst)\r\n  * Janet Simons (Co-Director, Digital Humanities Initiative)\r\n  * [Steve Young](https://github.com/hamhpc) (Unix/HPC System Administrator)\r\n* Hampshire College\r\n  * [Abigail Baines](https://github.com/abigaildiscovers) (Systems and Discovery Librarian)\r\n  * Bob Crowley (Director of Information Technology)\r\n* Mount Holyoke College\r\n  * [Sarah Goldstein](https://github.com/sgoldste) (Associate Director of Discovery and Access)\r\n  * [Shaun Trujillo](https://github.com/shauntru) (Digital Library Applications Manager)\r\n* Smith College\r\n  * [Tristan Chambers](https://github.com/TristanSmithlib) (Digital Library Applications Administrator)\r\n* Vassar College\r\n  * [Joanna DiPasquale](https://github.com/jjdipasquale) (Head of Digital Scholarship and Technology Services)\r\n  * Arianna Schlegel (Metadata and Systems Librarian)\r\n* Wesleyan University\r\n  * [Francesca Livermore](https://github.com/bookishgirl) (Digital Projects Librarian)\r\n  * John Neyssen (UNIX Systems Administer)\r\n  * Lori Stethers (Systems and Emerging Technologies Librarian)\r\n* Williams College\r\n  * [Karen Gorss Benko](https://github.com/kgb1420) (Catalogue Librarian)\r\n  * [Jessika Drmacich-Flach](https://github.com/jgd1) (Digital Resources Archivist)\r\n  * [David Keiser-Clark](https://github.com/dwk2) (Academic Application Developer)\r\n  * [Jonathan Leamon](https://github.com/jmleamon) (Director of Instructional Technology)\r\n  * Katie Nash (College Archivist and Special Collections Librarian)\r\n* Common Media Inc.\r\n  * [Patrick Dunlavey](https://github.com/patdunlavey) (Senior Drupal & Islandora Developer)\r\n  * [Gavin Morris](https://github.com/g7morris) (Digital Repositories Team Lead, DevOps)\r\n  * [Noah Smith](https://github.com/noahwsmith) (CEO)\r\n\r\n## What is Islandora?\r\n\r\n* see: [Islandora website](http://islandora.ca)\r\n\r\n## ICG Involvement in the Islandora Community\r\n\r\n* DLF 2016 pre-conference presentation: \"[Hack/Doc Partnerships for Library Projects]\"(https://dlfforum2016.sched.org/event/8LFu/s4c-hackdoc-partnerships-for-library-projects)\r\n* NERCOMP 2016 conference presentation: \"[pending]\"()\r\n\r\n## Islandora WebForm\r\n\r\n* [Summary of Steps for Creating an Islandora Webform](https://sites.google.com/site/islandoraconsortiagroup/home/iw-module/iw-brief-steps)\r\n* [Islandora Webform module](https://sites.google.com/site/islandoraconsortiagroup/home/iw-module)\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n### Github Repos\r\n\r\n* [Islandora Collaboration Group](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group)\r\n* [Awesome Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_awesome)\r\n* [Islandora Interest Groups](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups)\r\n* [Islandora DevOps Interest Group](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-DevOps-Interest-Group/tree/master/meetings)\r\n\r\n### Islandora Support\r\n* [Islandora: CLAW - next generation of Islandora](http://islandora.ca/CLAW)\r\n* [Islandora: Developers](http://islandora.ca/developers)\r\n* [Islandora: Resources](http://islandora.ca/resources) (modules, forms, logos, tools, beta, etc.)\r\n* [Islandora: Wiki](https://github.com/islandora/islandora/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Repository Utilities\r\n* [EULfedora - python library for creating and managing Fedora digital objects](http://eulfedora.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/)\r\n",
