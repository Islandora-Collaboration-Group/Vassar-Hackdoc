### What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon–bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time–with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work related to metadata and migration out of Islandora 7. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora (e.g. developers, DevOps folks), people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks interested in migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend.
 
### What will we be doing?
This year the Islandora Collaboration Group’s hack/doc will focus on metadata and migration. Our goal is to create useful documentation for our members and other members of the Islandora community as we face the task of migrating out of Islandora 7x.
