### What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon–bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time–with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work. 
 
### What will we be doing?

This hack/doc will be centered on further developing migration paths to Islandora 8, including tools for metadata migration. We may cover other topics as well; please voice your preferences on the [RSVP form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXkclFN-E_RDUjT9EqPe0NWD5hCm8guyV99bvRXxjRMWyx3w/viewform) and note if you are able to help lead any sessions.
