### What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon–bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time–with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work.
