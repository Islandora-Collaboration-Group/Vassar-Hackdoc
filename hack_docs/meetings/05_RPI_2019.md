Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is 27 minutes (15 miles) East of Schenectady.

Traveling via Amtrak:
The Albany Rensselaer station is 16 minutes (10 miles) South of Troy.

Getting around Troy:
The Rensselaer campus is located on a hill above downtown Troy. Please be advised that if you choose to walk from downtown up to Folsom Library, you’ll be climbing a marble staircase called The Approach which takes you up to 8th Street. From there you will have to climb several additional stairs to get up to the library. 
From the Marriott downtown, it is a nice, brisk walk.

## Parking
Rensselaer campus guest parking is very limited. We’ll provide a map that shows all of the streets where you can find available parking a short walking distance to the Library. 
Jen will make every attempt to secure parking in one of RPI’s lots, please stay tuned as she negotiates logistics with Rensselaer’s Campus Parking office.

Dinner is on your own and we can make recommendations and/or go out together or in groups. Some suggestions:

## More Info
 
### What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
 
A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon–bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time–with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work with ISLE. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora (e.g. developers, DevOps folks), people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks interested in migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend.
 
### What will we be doing?
 
Plans for the hack/doc are still being formed, but on one of the days will focus on ISLE, the other on LASIR. Other activities may include improving ISLE testing and documentation.
