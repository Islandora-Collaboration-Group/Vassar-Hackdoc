## Transportation
Troy and the Capital Region offer Uber and Lyft.

Traveling from NERCOMP at Union College, Schenectady, NY:
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is 27 minutes (15 miles) East of Schenectady.

Traveling via Amtrak:
The Albany Rensselaer station is 16 minutes (10 miles) South of Troy.

Traveling by Air:
Albany International Airport is 14 minutes (10 miles) Southwest of Troy.

Getting around Troy:
The Rensselaer campus is located on a hill above downtown Troy. Please be advised that if you choose to walk from downtown up to Folsom Library, you’ll be climbing a marble staircase called The Approach which takes you up to 8th Street. From there you will have to climb several additional stairs to get up to the library. 
From the Marriott downtown, it is a nice, brisk walk. 

## Maps
Travel information from the college website: [https://info.rpi.edu/map](https://info.rpi.edu/map)

## Parking
Rensselaer campus guest parking is very limited. Here is a map (https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=1oG4Z6lvirIZUDkPErfUMHAMscUx2eMvX&ll=42.73168212204002%2C-73.68271974205015&z=16) that shows all of the streets where you can find available parking a short walking distance to the Library. 
Full disclosure – parking at Rensselaer has always been a challenge for visitors for two reasons: 1. Rensselaer has small visitor parking lots, and any of the large lots are by permit and pass only for faculty, staff or students 2. The City of Troy who maintains the streets surrounding campus may or may not change the parking rules on any given week! Please note the following as you review the map link above:
1.	Rensselaer has two visitor lots. Both are metered and provide a credit card pay station. Parking in the visitor lots costs $7/day. Please be aware that spaces are very limited in these lots. The visitor lot closest to Folsom Library only has 9 spaces.
2.	Folsom Library and most of campus is surrounded by 4 streets: 8th Street, College Ave, 15th Street, and Sage Ave. 
* a.	There is decent street parking on College Ave, especially if you arrive early. 
* b.	There is limited street parking on 15th because of the Rensselaer Student Union.
* c.	Sage Ave. should have decent parking
* d.	Another possibility but a bit of a walk is Peoples Ave. 
* e.	I do not suggest you park on 8th Street (below Folsom Library) – this street only has 2 hr parking, and the City will ticket you.


## Food
Light breakfast, lunch, snacks and lots of coffee and tea will be provided. 

Dinner is on your own and we can make recommendations and/or go out together or in groups. Some suggestions:
* Sunhees
* Nighthawks
* The Shop
* Slidin’ Dirty
* Browns Tap Room (great for a large group and close to BW and Marriott)
* Little Pecks
* Illium Cafe

## WiFi and Remote Attendance
For Eduroam members, WiFi is available through Eduroam: [https://dotcio.rpi.edu/eduroam](https://dotcio.rpi.edu/eduroam)
For non Eduroam: Rensselaer doesn’t offer wireless connection to the public, but we can accomodate guests by creating personalized, but limited accounts. Jen will need to collect information to have George Biggar, Sys Admin create special logins. Please email Jen privately (kubaj@rpi.edu) and copy George Biggar (biggaw@rpi.edu)

## Schedule
A preliminary schedule is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175nYoEqMXRSqK-BCWMuz_Wu3JcBYgqXbeVhO5hDMGOM/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs). Please note this is a work in progress.

## More Info
 
### What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
 
A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon–bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time–with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work with ISLE. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora (e.g. developers, DevOps folks), people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks interested in migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend.
 
### What will we be doing?
 
Plans for the hack/doc are still being formed, but on one of the days will focus on ISLE, the other on LASIR. Other activities may include improving ISLE testing and documentation.
