# ICG Hack/Docs

## Purpose

A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon -- bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time -- with a substantial documentation component. 
This is a much more inclusive and open way to conduct a hackathon, incorporating multiple perspectives and insights into the problems at hand.
Typically, each project is broken into small chunks and worked on by groups of 2-3 people.
Discussions are an important by-product of working together.
