# Templates: How to Run a Hack/Doc

## Description

A Hack/Doc differs from a regular hackfest in its focus on a variety of skills beyond programming, including documentation, research, and testing. This approach promotes a lot of collaboration, with larger teams (8-10 people) gathered around a few topics. 

This set of templates offers a way for you to create your own hack/doc. These templates will continue improving with each hack/doc that we do.
