## About Us

ICG is a group of colleges working together to support and extend the Islandora tool through direct development, resource pooling, and advocacy.
ICG has an all-members, face-to-face meeting about every 6 months where overall strategy, organization, and progress is reviewed and discussed. Additionally, ICG has working groups which meet via hangouts/skype and also conducts code sprints to continue projects from hack/doc events.
General communication and meeting announcements happen via the islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com mailing list. Working groups or project teams may have mailing lists for discussions specific to that team or project.
