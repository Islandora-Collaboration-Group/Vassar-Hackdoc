# Islandora Collaboration Group: Information

## About Us

The Islandora Collaboration Group (ICG), founded in 2011, is a consortium of colleges collaborating together to support and extend the Islandora digital repository through direct development, resource pooling, and advocacy. The ICG holds monthly steering committee meetings to develop strategy and organization and plan progress. The ICG holds a face-to-face hack/doc meeting twice a year for code development, open to all members. Additionally, the ICG has working groups which meet electronically on specific topics (current topics include metadata and code sprints). General communication and meeting announcements happen via the islandora-consortium-group@googlegroups.com mailing list.
